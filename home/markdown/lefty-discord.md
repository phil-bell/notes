1. Which should be done: abolish capitalism, or reform capitalism? Why?
   ```
   Abolish Capitalism. In my opinion its simply not possible for the the people, workers and planets (environment and animals) needs to prioritised when the main driving force of our society system is to accrue or make as much "capital" as possible.

2. What is your own political philosophy? How do you feel about anarchism? Communism?
```
I find the best category I've found I can place myself in is an anarcho-communist, I believe the collective action and prioritization of the group and worker of communism married with the community focus and anti authoritarian (mostly just the fascist auth side) of Anarchism can be brought together to make an ideal social system. Also think Anarchists and Communists are on the same side and should work together.

The accomplishments and efficiency of their societal system was incredible.

For China I'm less fond. I think in the begining they did some great stuff, like what they did with the landlords, but in recent times they've lost their way and have become a mere capitalist dictatorship with some good social programs.

Cuba I honestly don't that much about other than their revolution was very successful even while under the thumb of the United States. I am concerned about capitalist enterprise squirming its way in now its no longer embargoded, but the people seem to be very protective of the revolution and will defend it to the best of their ability. Only other note I have for them is a little anacdote from when my father visited about a decade ago and be was amazed that it didn't matter where you went, the busy cities, remote beaches or rain forest, you always had full signal on you phone.

4. What is your stance on trans rights?
5. How did you get the invite here?
6. Do you agree with the rules, in particular rule 4?
