1. Which should be done: abolish capitalism, or reform capitalism? Why?
   ```
   Abolish Capitalism. Its simply not possible for the peoples, workers and planets (environment and animals) needs to prioritised when the main driving force of our society system is to accrue or make as much "capital" as possible.
   ```
2. What is your own political philosophy? How do you feel about anarchism? Communism?
   ```
   The best category I've found I can place myself in is an anarcho-communist, I believe the collective action and prioritization of the group and worker of communism married with the community focus and anti authoritarian (mostly just the fascist auth side) of Anarchism can be brought together to make an ideal social system. Also think Anarchists and Communists are on the same side and should work together.

3. How do you feel about The USSR (before it collapsed), modern China and Cuba? Why? It's ok if you don't know, just say you don't know. There are no 'right' answers to these questions, we just want to see if you'll be a good fit here. ðŸ™‚
   ```
   I feel the Soviet Union really achieved some great things under the circumstances (those being capitalists endlessly undermining it and trying to destroy it). When you look at its social and scientific advancements where truly incredible, the near complete eradication of homelessness, equality in the work place, basically all the firsts in the space race, and even the ability to go toe to toe with NATO militarily while having significantly fewer, resources, funds and people. All this made even more incredible when you remember it started the beginning of the 20th century a feudal farming based society. The accomplishments and efficiency of their societal system were incredible in my opinion.

   For China I'm less fond. I think in the beginning they did some great stuff, like what they did with the landlords, but in recent times they've lost their way and have become a mere capitalist dictatorship with some good social programs.

   Cuba I honestly don't that much about other than their revolution was very successful even while under the thumb of the United States. I am concerned about capitalist enterprise squirming its way in now its no longer embargoed, but the people seem to be very protective of the revolution.

4. What is your stance on trans rights?
   ```
   Trans rights are human rights, and JKR can fuck off.

   In seriousness though, am very pro trans rights and try to be an ally where ever I can.

5. How did you get the invite here?

   ```
   Found the link on a left wing subreddit
   ```
6. Do you agree with the rules, in particular rule 4?

   `No punching left. Do not use either imperialist arguments or media to criticise existing socialist states. Criticism of left ideologies and existing socialist states should be evidence based, constructive and made in good faith.`
   ```
   Totally, theres no point in creating more fractures in the left, and just like in most situations constructive thead back is the most valuable thead back.
