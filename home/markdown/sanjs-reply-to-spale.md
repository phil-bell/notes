hey Spale, thank you for thinking about me when looking for a plant person. I would potentially be open to helping you building out a plant based battersea store.

I am however very happy at my current role and have several private clients/contracts I want to continue to work with.

So with that in mind I can offer you up to 3 days a weekdays at a rate Â£25 an hour for my expertese.

Morning Spale and thanks for your reply. I'm going to be blunt with you but it sounds like what you're actually asking for is someone to manage the battersea store.

After some concidiration I've decided I am open to this position but will need to be on my terms.

First being that the wage will need to be significatly higher, 35k is the absolute floor I would accept for a salary.

I would need to be my shop in which I decide what we buy and sell, who we work with and what we do.

I also want to be able to pick how many staff and who they are. So the shop is properly staffed and people are not ecesivly over worked.

Finally, this related to the previous, the time of ecesive over time and people not know their calander needs to end. The shop needs to be sufficiently staffed to avoid the need to over time and staffs calanders need to be static. No last minute "can you work the weekend" on a Friday. If you days are Mon-Fri or Fri-Sun those are you're days, no more no less and no shifting.
